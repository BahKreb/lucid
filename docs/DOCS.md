**ðŸ¥¤  - the fresh UI library in javascript**



#### Basic Usage

> In **Soda**, each component is a function that takes in an object as a parameter and returns a `jsx` expression. The parameter it takes in is a local data container for the component. It also contains `update` function which triggers a re-render for the component.

> To render a component onto the screen use `render` function.  `render` takes in the `jsx` expression of the component and the **DOM element** that you want the component to be rendered to.

```jsx
// You dont have to name the parameter as "component",
// name it whatever you like to.
function App(component) {
  return <div>Hello, world!</div>
}

Soda.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"))
```

Component `App` returns a `div` with "Hello, world! in it. Then the `.render` function will render the component to the given DOM element.



#### Local State

```jsx
function Counter(component) {
  // A state with an initial value of 0 is created.
  // use count to access the value and
  // use setCount(newValue) to change the value.
  const [count, setCount] = Soda.state(0);
  
  // This function increases the count by 1, 
  // then triggers a re-render for the component.
  const increase = () => { setCount(count + 1) }
  
  return <div onClick={increase}>Count: {count}</div>
}

Soda.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById("app"))
```

In order to add local state to a component, we use `Soda.state` and give it a initial value. `Soda.state` return an array with only 2 elements: the state and the set state function. The function `increase`  will increase the count by 1 and will trigger a re-render. In the `jsx` expression, we set `onClick` to `increase` which will call `increase` function when clicked to the component.

> **Soda** only updates what needs to be updated in the DOM which makes it blazingly fast.



#### Life Cycle Hooks

> Life cycle hooks are a must in any component-based UI library. In **Soda**, there is 1 function which can represent multiple hooks at once (ex. oncomponentmount, oncomponentupdate).

```jsx
function App(component) {
  const [count, setCount] = Soda.state(0);
    
  Soda.effect(() => {
    // Will be called each time the component updates.
  });
    
  Soda.effect(() => {
    // Will be called once the component renders for the first time.
  }, []); 
    
  Soda.effect(() => {
    // Will be called after the update each time the count changes.
  }, [count]);
        
  Soda.effect(() => {
    // This function will be called on each cleanup,
    // which means the update after this line has been run.
    return () => {};
  });
    
  return <div></div>
}

function Greeting(component) {
  return <div>Hi!</div>
}

Soda.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"))
```



#### Components within Components

```jsx
function App(component) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
      <Greeting />
    </div>
  )
}

function Greeting(component) {
  return <div>Hi!</div>
}

Soda.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"))
```

It's possible for components to contain other components in it's `jsx` expression. 

> We recommend separating components into smaller components to both increase performance and readability of the code. If you had only 1 component containing all of your app, in each re-render, **Soda** would need to check a lot of things which might decrease the performance drastically.



#### Passing Attributes to the Components

```jsx
function Post(component) {
  // It's just for easier access to post property.
  const post = component.attrs.post;

  return <div>{post.content}</div>
}

Soda.render(
  <Post post={{ content: " is awesome!" }} />, 
  document.getElementById("app")
)
```

Any attribute passed on to a component can be accessed from `attrs` property.



#### Rendering an Array of Components

```jsx
const posts = [
  { content: "Hi!" },
  { content: "Hello, world!" }
]

function App(component) {
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => <Post post={post} />)}
    </div>
  )
}

function Post(component) {
  const post = component.attrs.post;
    
  return <div>{post.content}</div>
}

Soda.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"))
```

We make use of `map` function and pass attribute to the `Post` component.



#### Optimizing Re-renders for Array of Components

> If you tried to add or remove one element to the array, then trigger a re-render by calling `update`, **Soda** would need to re-render the whole array of components since there is no hint to tell **Soda** what had actually happened. Which may cause performance issues with large arrays (think of twitter, when you scroll to the bottom, to show more tweets, it would have to process all other tweets even though it's completely unnecessary). To overcome this problem, you can hint **Soda** with `key` property.

> `key`'s should be unique among siblings and should be stable (for ex. post id or user id from database).

> `key` property is needed for dynamic arrays, but not needed for static arrays.

```jsx
const posts = [
  { id: 0, content: "Hi!" },
  { id: 1, content: "Hello, world!" }
]

function App(component) {
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map((post) => <Post key={post.id} post={post} />)}
    </div>
  )
}

function Post(component) {
  const post = component.attrs.post;
  return <div>{post.content}</div>
}

Soda.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"))
```

Each post has a unique `key` attribute which will optimize re-renders adding or removing from the `posts` array.



#### Input from Form Elements

```jsx
function App(component) {
  // Initialize component's state
  const [todos, setTodos] = Soda.state([]);
  
  // This variable will have a reference to the
  // DOM specified after the first render.
  const input = Soda.ref();

  // Using input.dom add a todo to todos array.
  const addTodo = () => {
    todos.push(input.dom.value);
    setTodos(todos);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={input} />
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add todo</button>
      <div>
        {component.state.todos.map((todo, index) => <Todo key={index} todo={todo} />)}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

function Todo(component) {
  const todo = component.attrs.todo;

  return <div>{todo}</div>
}

Soda.render(<App />, document.getElementById("app"))
```

Since form elements keep their own state themselves, we can reference them using `ref` and access their property when necessary. In the `jsx` expression, we pass `todo` as an attribute and also we have to pass an index to the `key` property since it's a dynamic array meaning we might add or remove elements to it.
